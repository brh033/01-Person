# A class representing a person. A person can be initialized with a
# name, as well as x and y coordinates. However, there are default
# values for all those (i.e. player 1, 0 and 0 respectively). A person
# also has a size which is set to 1 by default. A person can go left, 
# go right, go up and go down. A person also has a string function 
# that prints out their name location, and size. A person also has a 
# function that calculates the euclidean distance from another person 
# object.
